    Construct a "fast" RemBert tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's *tokenizers* library). Based on
    [Unigram](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/components.html?highlight=unigram#models). This
    tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) file (generally has a *.spm* extension) that
            contains the vocabulary necessary to instantiate a tokenizer.
        do_lower_case (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to lowercase the input when tokenizing.
        remove_space (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to strip the text when tokenizing (removing excess spaces before and after the string).
        keep_accents (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to keep accents when tokenizing.
        bos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[CLS]"`):
            The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
            sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

            </Tip>

        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[SEP]"`):
            The end of sequence token. .. note:: When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token
            that is used for the end of sequence. The token used is the `sep_token`.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[SEP]"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[CLS]"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[MASK]"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
